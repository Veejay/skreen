# Skreen

## Dependencies

- sharp (https://github.com/lovell/sharp)
- chromeless (https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless)

## Intended uses

Meant to replace a phantomjs-based solution that is complicated to maintain. This is way less code and way more modern and efficient.

## Using it

If you're here, you know what it's about. Clone, yarn/npm install and run node index.js after having tweaked parameters.

## TODO

- [ ] Transform into Express application 
- [ ] See if more sizes can be cut concurrently
- [ ] See if more screenshots can be taken concurrently
- [ ] Deploy to GAE
